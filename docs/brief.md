# Project Brief: SRE Orchestrator

### Executive Summary

The SRE Orchestrator is a virtual Site Reliability Engineer that automates the initial investigation of production issues. It uses an LLM to understand user-reported problems from a REST API and intelligently routes diagnostics to specialized AI agents (e.g., Kubernetes, Database). By correlating data from logs, metrics, and system state, it pinpoints root causes and provides actionable insights to the SRE team, drastically reducing mean time to resolution (MTTR).

### Problem Statement

In modern, complex, cloud-native environments, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) teams are overwhelmed by the volume and complexity of production incidents. When an issue occurs (e.g., a user flow returns a 500 error), the initial investigation is a manual, time-consuming process of data collection and correlation across disparate systems: Kubernetes dashboards, observability platforms (like Prometheus and Grafana), log aggregators (like Splunk or ELK), and application-specific monitoring tools.

This manual process leads to:
*   **High Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR):** Engineers spend critical time gathering data rather than solving the problem.
*   **Cognitive Overload:** The sheer volume of data makes it difficult to identify the signal from the noise.
*   **Inconsistent Triage:** The quality of the initial investigation depends heavily on the experience of the on-call engineer.
*   **Knowledge Silos:** Expertise on how to debug specific subsystems often resides with a few key individuals.

Existing solutions like standard alerting and monitoring systems are effective at *detecting* problems but fall short in *diagnosing* them. They can report that a pod is down or that latency is high, but they lack the intelligence to correlate these symptoms and suggest a root cause. This leaves a significant gap between problem detection and resolution, a gap that the SRE Orchestrator is designed to fill.

### Proposed Solution

The SRE Orchestrator is an intelligent, AI-driven automation platform that acts as a "virtual SRE" to perform the initial triage and investigation of production incidents. It will be deployed as a lightweight, containerized application within the target Kubernetes cluster, attaching itself to the existing observability stack.

**Core Concept & Approach:**

1.  **Issue Ingestion:** The Orchestrator exposes a secure REST API endpoint where alerts or manually reported issues can be submitted.
2.  **Natural Language Understanding:** It leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to parse the initial problem description and identify key entities (e.g., service name, error code, user impact).
3.  **Intelligent Agent Routing:** Based on the initial analysis, the Orchestrator delegates the investigation to a suite of specialized, MCP-based AI agents. For example:
    *   An "Authentication Error" would route to the **Authentication Agent**.
    *   A "Database Connection Failed" would route to the **Database Agent**.
    *   A "Pod CrashLoopBackOff" would route to the **Kubernetes Agent**.
4.  **Automated Data Collection:** Each agent is responsible for querying its specific domain (e.g., Prometheus for metrics, Kubernetes API for pod status, application logs for errors) to gather relevant data.
5.  **Knowledge-Enhanced Analysis:** The agents are provided with context from a searchable knowledge base, which can be populated with the application's runbooks, best practices, and architectural documents.
6.  **Correlation and Insight Generation:** The Orchestrator collects the findings from all activated agents and uses its knowledge graph of the system's topology to correlate the data, identify likely root causes, and generate a concise, evidence-backed report.
7.  **Actionable Recommendations:** The final output, delivered via the REST API, provides the SRE team with a clear summary of the issue, the evidence gathered, and a set of recommended next steps for resolution.

**Key Differentiator:**

Unlike traditional monitoring tools that only present data, the SRE Orchestrator *interprets* it. By combining an understanding of the system's architecture (via the knowledge graph) with the operational knowledge from runbooks, it moves beyond simple data aggregation to intelligent, automated diagnostics.

### Target Users

#### Primary User Segment: Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) / DevOps Engineers

*   **Profile:** Technical professionals responsible for the reliability, scalability, and performance of production systems. They are often the first responders to incidents and are under pressure to resolve issues quickly.
*   **Current Behaviors:** When an alert fires, they typically SSH into machines, run `kubectl` commands, query monitoring dashboards, and manually search through logs. Their workflow is highly reactive and involves juggling multiple tools and data sources.
*   **Needs and Pain Points:**
    *   They need to reduce the manual toil of incident investigation.
    *   They need to quickly understand the blast radius of an issue.
    *   They need a centralized view of all relevant data for a given incident.
    *   They need to onboard new team members faster by codifying expert knowledge.
*   **Goals:** To minimize Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR), improve system uptime, and spend more time on proactive engineering rather than reactive firefighting.

#### Secondary User Segment: Application Developers

*   **Profile:** Software engineers who build and maintain the applications running in the production environment. They are often called in to assist with incident resolution when the issue is suspected to be code-related.
*   **Current Behaviors:** They rely on the SRE team to provide them with the necessary context (logs, metrics, etc.) to debug application-level problems. This can lead to slow, back-and-forth communication.
*   **Needs and Pain Points:**
    *   They need direct, easy access to the relevant diagnostic data without having to become Kubernetes or observability experts.
    *   They need to understand how their service is behaving in the context of the larger system.
*   **Goals:** To quickly identify and fix bugs in their code and to better understand the production performance of their applications.

### Goals & Success Metrics

#### Business Objectives

*   **Reduce Operational Costs:** Decrease the man-hours spent on manual incident triage by at least 40% within the first 6 months of deployment.
*   **Improve Customer Retention:** Contribute to a 10% reduction in customer-reported outages by enabling faster incident resolution.
*   **Establish a New Market Category:** Become the leading solution for AI-driven SRE automation within 2 years.

#### User Success Metrics

*   **Reduced Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR):** A 50% reduction in the average time from incident detection to the start of remediation.
*   **Increased Developer Self-Service:** A 25% increase in the number of incidents that are resolved by developers without needing to escalate to a senior SRE.
*   **High User Confidence:** Achieve a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 50+ among SRE and DevOps users.

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

*   **Automation Rate:** Percentage of incidents where the Orchestrator correctly identifies the root cause without human intervention. (Target: 60%)
*   **Average Number of Queries per Incident:** The number of manual commands/queries an engineer runs *after* receiving the Orchestrator's report. (Target: < 5)
*   **Adoption Rate:** Number of teams within a customer organization that actively use the Orchestrator for their services. (Target: 80% of teams within 1 year)

### MVP Scope

#### Core Features (Must Have)

*   **REST API Ingestion:** A single, secure endpoint to receive incident reports in a structured JSON format.
*   **Basic LLM Integration:** Connect to a single, cloud-based LLM (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini) to parse the incoming issue description.
*   **Kubernetes Agent:** The first specialized agent that can connect to the Kubernetes API of the host cluster and retrieve basic information about pods, namespaces, and deployments.
*   **Log Ingestion (Pods):** The ability to pull logs from specified pods based on the Kubernetes Agent's findings.
*   **Static Knowledge Graph:** A simple, file-based representation of the system's components and their relationships, which can be manually created and updated.
*   **Basic Correlation Logic:** A simple rules engine that can correlate findings from the Kubernetes Agent and log analysis (e.g., "IF pod is in `CrashLoopBackOff` AND logs contain `OutOfMemoryError`, THEN suggest increasing memory limits").
*   **REST API Output:** An endpoint to retrieve the final report, including the initial problem, the evidence gathered, and the suggested root cause.
*   **Helm Chart Deployment:** A basic Helm chart to deploy the Orchestrator and its components into a Kubernetes cluster.

#### Out of Scope for MVP

*   **Multiple LLM Support:** The MVP will be hard-coded to a single LLM provider.
*   **Advanced Agents:** Agents for databases, authentication, or other specialized domains will be deferred.
*   **Metrics Ingestion:** Integration with Prometheus, Grafana, or other observability platforms.
*   **Dynamic Knowledge Graph:** The knowledge graph will not be self-updating in the MVP.
*   **Runbook Ingestion:** The ability to automatically ingest and search existing documentation.
*   **UI/Dashboard:** All interaction will be via the REST API.

#### MVP Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered a success if it can be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster and, for a predefined set of common issues (e.g., a pod OOMKilled, a misconfigured environment variable), it can correctly identify the root cause and provide a relevant, actionable recommendation 80% of the time.

### Post-MVP Vision

#### Phase 2 Features

*   **Expanded Agent Library:** Introduce new, specialized agents for common infrastructure and application components, such as:
    *   **Database Agent:** To analyze query performance, connection pools, and replication lag.
    *   **Authentication Agent:** To diagnose issues related to identity, access, and authorization.
    *   **Network Agent:** To investigate problems with DNS, firewalls, and inter-service communication.
*   **Metrics Integration:** Full integration with Prometheus and other popular observability platforms to correlate metrics with logs and events.
*   **Automated Runbook Ingestion:** A pipeline to ingest existing markdown-based runbooks and make them searchable by the agents.
*   **Dynamic Knowledge Graph:** The knowledge graph will be updated in real-time based on changes in the Kubernetes cluster, providing a constantly current view of the system's topology.

#### Long-term Vision

In 1-2 years, the SRE Orchestrator will evolve from a diagnostic tool to a proactive reliability platform. It will not only investigate failures but also predict them. By analyzing historical data and identifying patterns, it will be able to flag potential issues *before* they impact users. The long-term vision includes features like automated remediation for common problems and a "reliability score" for services, helping teams to continuously improve their operational posture.

#### Expansion Opportunities

*   **Multi-Cloud Support:** Extend the Orchestrator to work across different cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and their managed Kubernetes services.
*   **Serverless and PaaS Integration:** Create agents that can diagnose issues in serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda) and Platform-as-a-Service environments.
*   **Enterprise Edition:** A commercial version with features like advanced security, role-based access control, and integrations with enterprise ticketing systems (e.g., Jira, ServiceNow).

### Technical Considerations

#### Platform Requirements

*   **Target Platforms:** Kubernetes (v1.21+)
*   **Browser/OS Support:** N/A (API-only)
*   **Performance Requirements:** The Orchestrator must be lightweight and have a minimal performance impact on the host cluster. It should consume no more than 0.5 vCPU and 512MiB of RAM under normal load.

#### Technology Preferences

*   **Backend:** **Go** is preferred for its performance, concurrency model, and strong ecosystem of Kubernetes libraries. **Python** is a viable alternative due to its extensive AI/ML libraries.
*   **Database:** For the knowledge graph, a graph database like **Neo4j** or **ArangoDB** would be ideal for the long-term vision. For the MVP, a simple in-memory store or a file-based approach is sufficient.
*   **Hosting/Infrastructure:** The application must be fully containerized (**Docker**) and deployable via **Helm**.

#### Architecture Considerations

*   **Repository Structure:** A monorepo is preferred to manage the core Orchestrator and the various agents in a single location.
*   **Service Architecture:** A microservices-based architecture, where the Orchestrator and each agent run as separate pods, will provide the best scalability and resilience.
*   **Integration Requirements:** The system must be able to integrate with the Kubernetes API, and in the future, with Prometheus and other standard observability tools.
*   **Security/Compliance:** The Orchestrator will require a Kubernetes Service Account with read-only access to the necessary cluster resources. All external communication (e.g., to cloud-based LLMs) must be over TLS.

### Constraints & Assumptions

#### Constraints

*   **Budget:** The project will be developed by a small team, so the MVP must be achievable with limited resources.
*   **Timeline:** The MVP should be ready for internal testing within 3 months.
*   **Resources:** The team will consist of 1-2 developers, a part-time product manager, and access to SREs for subject matter expertise.
*   **Technical:** The solution must be deployable on an existing Kubernetes cluster without requiring any significant changes to the cluster's configuration.

#### Key Assumptions

*   **Access to Kubernetes API:** We assume that the Orchestrator will be granted the necessary RBAC permissions to read data from the Kubernetes API.
*   **Standardized Logging:** We assume that the target applications are following a structured logging format (e.g., JSON), which will make log parsing easier.
*   **LLM Availability:** We assume that we will have reliable access to a cloud-based LLM API.
*   **MCP Agent Reusability:** We assume that existing MCP agents (like a Prometheus agent) can be leveraged, and that new agents can be developed using the Langgraph framework.

### Risks & Open Questions

#### Key Risks

*   **LLM Accuracy and Consistency:** The LLM's ability to correctly interpret problem descriptions is critical. Inaccurate interpretations could lead to incorrect agent routing and diagnostics. (Impact: High)
*   **Complexity of Target Environments:** Every Kubernetes environment is different. The Orchestrator may struggle to work reliably across a wide variety of custom configurations and applications. (Impact: High)
*   **Data Overload:** The volume of data (especially logs) can be immense. The agents must be designed to efficiently filter and process this data to avoid performance bottlenecks. (Impact: Medium)
*   **Security:** Granting an application read access to the Kubernetes API and logs carries inherent security risks. A security breach could expose sensitive operational data. (Impact: High)

#### Open Questions

*   Which specific LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini, Claude) will provide the best balance of performance, accuracy, and cost for our use case?
*   How will the knowledge graph be initially populated? Will it be a manual process, or can we automate parts of it?
*   What is the most effective and secure way to manage credentials for accessing different data sources (e.g., Kubernetes API, Prometheus)?
*   How will we test the Orchestrator in a realistic but safe environment before deploying it to a production cluster?

#### Areas Needing Further Research

*   **Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Langgraph:** A deeper investigation is needed to understand the capabilities and limitations of these frameworks for building our specialized agents.
*   **Graph Database Technologies:** A comparative analysis of different graph databases to select the best fit for our long-term vision.
*   **LLM Fine-tuning vs. Prompt Engineering:** Research whether we will get better results by fine-tuning a smaller model on SRE-specific data or by using advanced prompt engineering with a larger, general-purpose model.
