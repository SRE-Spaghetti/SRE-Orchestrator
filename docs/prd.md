Thank you for providing the additional details. I have updated the project plan with your choices for the initial agents, LLM, and knowledge graph. This information will be crucial for the next phase of the workflow.

Based on our updated project brief and the Greenfield Full-Stack Application Development workflow, the next step is to create a comprehensive **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**. This document will formalize the project's features and requirements, guiding the rest of the development process.

Here is the first draft of the **`prd.md`** document for the SRE Orchestrator, structured based on the standard PRD template.

### Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**1.0 Introduction**
* **1.1 Project Name**: SRE Orchestrator
* **1.2 Overview**: The SRE Orchestrator is a virtual SRE engineer designed to automate and streamline the process of diagnosing issues in distributed, cloud-native systems. It acts as a central intelligence layer that receives issue reports, leverages an LLM to understand the problem, and orchestrates specialized AI agents to gather and correlate data from various system components. The goal is to provide SRE teams with actionable, evidence-based insights for rapid issue resolution, reducing the mean time to resolution (MTTR) and operational toil.

**2.0 Vision and Goals**
* **2.1 Vision**: To create an intelligent, self-diagnosing system that proactively identifies and pinpoints the root cause of user-facing issues in cloud-native applications, allowing SRE teams to focus on strategic, long-term reliability improvements.
* **2.2 Goals**:
    * Reduce MTTR for user-reported issues by at least 50%.
    * Automate the initial diagnosis and data collection process.
    * Provide a unified view of correlated events, logs, and metrics.
    * Enable the system to learn from existing SRE runbooks and documentation.
    * Ensure seamless deployment within an existing Kubernetes cluster.

**3.0 Target Audience**
* **Primary Users**: Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), DevOps engineers, and system administrators.
* **Secondary Users**: Application developers and incident commanders who need rapid insights into system health.

**4.0 Features and Requirements**
* **4.1 Core Orchestrator Functionality**:
    * **FR-1.1**: The system shall expose a REST API to accept issue reports with details such as error type (e.g., 400, 500 errors), timestamp, and a brief description.
    * **FR-1.2**: The orchestrator shall use an LLM to interpret the user-reported issue and determine the appropriate diagnostic agents to invoke.
    * **FR-1.3**: The orchestrator shall manage the state and context of an ongoing investigation, including a digital twin/knowledge graph of the system.
    * **FR-1.4**: The orchestrator shall correlate information gathered from all invoked agents to generate a single, consolidated report of potential issues and supporting evidence.
    * **FR-1.5**: The system shall expose a REST API to provide the investigation results, including a list of possible root causes and actionable suggestions.

* **4.2 Agent System**:
    * **FR-2.1**: The system shall support the integration of specialized AI agents based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
    * **FR-2.2**: The initial set of agents will include:
        * **Kubernetes Agent**: Shall interact with the Kubernetes API to collect live deployment status of pods, namespaces, persistent volumes, and other constructs.
        * **Database Agent**: Shall diagnose data-related problems by collecting metrics, logs, and query performance data from databases.
        * **Observability Agent**: Shall ingest and analyze application logs, metrics, events, and alarms from the observability stack (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK).

* **4.3 Knowledge Management**:
    * **FR-3.1**: The system shall be able to ingest and index existing documentation (e.g., runbooks, best known methods) provided by application owners.
    * **FR-3.2**: This indexed documentation shall be made available as a searchable resource for the diagnostic agents to use during an investigation.
    * **FR-3.3**: The system shall use a knowledge graph to maintain a context of the system state and the relationships between different components.

* **4.4 Technology Stack**:
    * **FR-4.1**: **LLM**: The system shall use **OpenAI's GPT-5 mini** for its core intelligence.
    * **FR-4.2**: **LLM Framework**: **LangChain** shall be used for interacting with the OpenAI API and orchestrating the agents.
    * **FR-4.3**: **Knowledge Graph**: **Neo4j** shall be used for implementing the digital twin and knowledge graph.
    * **FR-4.4**: **Deployment**: The system shall be deployed within a Kubernetes cluster using standard cloud-native technologies (Kubernetes, Helm, Docker).

**5.0 Out of Scope**
* **5.1**: Automatic remediation or resolution of issues.
* **5.2**: Full-stack security implementation and access control in the initial version.
* **5.3**: Creation of new runbooks or best practices; the system will only ingest existing ones.

The next step is to get the UX team involved to create the UI/UX specification.

How would you like to proceed?
* **Review and Refine**: Let's review the PRD and make changes.
* **Proceed to UI/UX**: The PRD is complete, let's move on to the next step.
