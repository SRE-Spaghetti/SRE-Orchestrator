# Epic 4: MCP Server Integration - Functional Requirements

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the functional requirements for the integration of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) within the SRE Orchestrator. This integration is the cornerstone of the orchestrator's extensibility model, allowing it to leverage external tools and data sources to perform advanced diagnostics and automated remediation tasks.

## 2. Core Concepts

*   **LangGraph:** A framework used to build intelligent, stateful "agents." It models workflows as a **graph** (a collection of nodes and edges), which allows for sophisticated, cyclical processes where the AI can loop, reflect, and call tools multiple times until a task is complete. This is a departure from simpler, linear AI chains. Key features include built-in **state management** (so the agent remembers previous steps) and the ability to incorporate **human-in-the-loop** checkpoints for review and approval. In our project, LangGraph will be used to define the complex logic for SRE agents that perform tasks like incident triage and root cause analysis.

*   **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** A universal standard that allows an AI application (the "MCP Host") to connect to external tools and data sources via a standardized "MCP Server." This eliminates the need for custom, one-off integrations for each external tool.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Extensible Tool Integration
The SRE Orchestrator must be able to integrate with a variety of external SRE tools and data sources to enhance its diagnostic and remediation capabilities.

### 3.2. Standardized Communication
To avoid building and maintaining numerous custom integrations, the orchestrator will adopt the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as the standard for interacting with external tools.

### 3.3. MCP Host Functionality
The SRE Orchestrator will act as an "MCP Host." It will include an "MCP Client" that can connect to one or more external "MCP Servers."

### 3.4. Configuration-Driven Connections
The specific MCP Servers the orchestrator connects to must be configurable via a dedicated configuration file. This allows operators to easily add, remove, or modify tool integrations without changing the orchestrator's code.

### 3.5. Agent-Tool Interaction
The `LangGraph` agents running within the orchestrator must be able to discover and invoke the capabilities (e.g., functions, data lookups) exposed by the configured MCP Servers. The agents should be able to dynamically adapt to the tools available through the active MCP connections.

### 3.6. Health and Status Monitoring
The orchestrator must provide a mechanism to monitor the status of its connections to all configured MCP Servers. This information should be exposed through the application's health check endpoint (e.g., `/health`) to aid in operational monitoring and troubleshooting.
