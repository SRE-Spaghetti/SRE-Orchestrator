# Goals and Background Context

### Goals

*   Automate the initial triage and investigation of production incidents.
*   Reduce Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) for SRE teams.
*   Provide a centralized, intelligent view of diagnostic data.
*   Codify expert SRE knowledge into a repeatable, automated process.
*   Enable developer self-service for incident investigation.

### Background Context

This project aims to address the significant operational overhead faced by SRE teams in modern cloud-native environments. The current process for diagnosing production failures is manual, time-consuming, and requires a high level of expertise. The SRE Orchestrator will fill the gap between incident detection and resolution by acting as a virtual SRE, intelligently coordinating AI agents to perform automated diagnostics and provide actionable insights. This will free up valuable engineering time for more proactive reliability work.
