# Checklist Results Report

### Executive Summary

*   **Overall PRD Completeness:** 95%
*   **MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right
*   **Readiness for Architecture Phase:** Ready
*   **Most Critical Gaps or Concerns:** The PRD is very strong. The only minor gap is the lack of explicit user experience requirements, but this was a deliberate decision for the API-only MVP and is acceptable.

### Category Analysis Table

| Category                         | Status | Critical Issues                                |
| -------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context  | ✅ PASS | None.                                          |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition          | ✅ PASS | None. The scope is well-defined and realistic. |
| 3. User Experience Requirements  | ⚪ N/A  | Not applicable for the API-only MVP.           |
| 4. Functional Requirements       | ✅ PASS | None. Requirements are clear and testable.     |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements   | ✅ PASS | None. NFRs are specific and cover key areas.   |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure        | ✅ PASS | None. The epics are logical and stories are well-sized. |
| 7. Technical Guidance            | ✅ PASS | None. Clear constraints are provided for the architect. |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | ✅ PASS | None.                                          |
| 9. Clarity & Communication       | ✅ PASS | None. The document is well-structured and clear. |

### Top Issues by Priority

*   **BLOCKERS:** None.
*   **HIGH:** None.
*   **MEDIUM:** None.
*   **LOW:** None.

### MVP Scope Assessment

The MVP scope is well-defined and appropriate. It focuses on delivering a core, valuable piece of functionality (automated data collection and basic analysis) without getting bogged down in non-essential features. The decision to defer the UI, advanced agents, and metrics integration is a good one.

### Technical Readiness

The PRD provides clear technical constraints and guidance for the Architect. The decisions on the monorepo, microservices architecture, and the primary technology (Python and LangGraph) give a strong starting point. The identified areas for further research (LLMs, graph databases) are also well-noted.

### Recommendations

No major recommendations. The PRD is in excellent shape.

### Final Decision

✅ **READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for the architectural design phase.
