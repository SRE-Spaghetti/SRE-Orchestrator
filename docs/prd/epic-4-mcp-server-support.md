# Epic 4: MCP Server Support - Brownfield Enhancement

**Goal:** Enable the SRE Orchestrator to connect to and utilize external Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for enhanced diagnostic capabilities, allowing extensible tool integration through configuration-driven MCP server management.

### Story 4.1: MCP Configuration Schema and Loading

*   **As a** DevOps Engineer,
*   **I want** to configure MCP servers via a YAML/JSON configuration file,
*   **so that** the SRE Orchestrator can connect to external MCP servers for enhanced diagnostic tools.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  A configuration schema is defined for MCP server connections with fields for server URL, transport type, and optional authentication.
2.  A configuration file (e.g., `mcp_config.yaml`) is created following the schema with example MCP server configurations.
3.  A configuration loading service is implemented that parses the MCP configuration file on application startup.
4.  The configuration loader validates the schema and provides clear error messages for invalid configurations.
5.  The system gracefully handles missing MCP configuration files (optional feature).

### Story 4.2: MCP Client Integration and Connection Management

*   **As the** Orchestrator,
*   **I want** to establish connections to configured MCP servers using the MCP Python client library,
*   **so that** I can utilize external tools and capabilities provided by MCP servers.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  The MCP Python client library is added to the project dependencies.
2.  An MCP connection manager service is implemented that handles client connections to configured servers.
3.  Connection initialization includes proper error handling for unreachable servers, authentication failures, and protocol mismatches.
4.  Connection timeouts and retry logic are implemented to handle transient network issues.
5.  MCP client connections are established during application startup based on the loaded configuration.
6.  Connection status and errors are logged with appropriate detail for debugging.

### Story 4.3: Startup Integration and Error Handling

*   **As an** SRE,
*   **I want** the SRE Orchestrator to initialize MCP connections during startup with comprehensive error handling,
*   **so that** I can quickly identify and resolve MCP connectivity issues without impacting core functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  MCP connection initialization is integrated into the FastAPI application startup sequence.
2.  The application startup includes MCP connection health checks and reports connection status.
3.  Failed MCP connections are logged as warnings but do not prevent application startup.
4.  The `/health` endpoint is enhanced to include MCP connection status information.
5.  Existing functionality (incident API endpoints) remains unaffected by MCP connection failures.
6.  Clear documentation is provided for MCP configuration format and troubleshooting connection issues.
