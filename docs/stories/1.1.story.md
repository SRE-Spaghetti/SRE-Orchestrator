Title: Project Scaffolding & Health Check

### Story

As a DevOps Engineer, I want to initialize the Python project structure with LangGraph at the core of the orchestrator and create a basic HTTP server with FastAPI with a `/health` endpoint, so that I have a runnable application to build upon and a way to verify it's running correctly.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new Python project is initialized with a standard, scalable layout.
2.  A basic HTTP server is implemented using FastAPI.
3.  A `GET /health` endpoint is created.
4.  When called, the `/health` endpoint returns a `200 OK` status code and a JSON body: `{"status": "ok"}`.

### Dev Notes

#### Tech Stack & Project Structure
- **Language:** Python 3.12.11 [Source: `architecture/tech-stack.md`]
- **Framework:** FastAPI 0.116.1 [Source: `architecture/tech-stack.md`]
- **Dependency Management:** Poetry 2.2.2 [Source: `architecture/tech-stack.md`]
- **Project Structure:** A monorepo structure will be used. The main orchestrator service should be located at `services/orchestrator/`. [Source: `architecture/source-tree.md`]
- **Application Entrypoint:** The main FastAPI application should be in `services/orchestrator/app/main.py`. [Source: `architecture/source-tree.md`]

#### API Specifications
- **Endpoint:** `GET /health`
- **Success Response:**
  - **Status Code:** 200 OK
  - **Body:** `{"status": "ok"}`
  [Source: `architecture/rest-api-spec.md`]

#### Coding Standards
- **Formatting:** Use `black` for code formatting. [Source: `architecture/coding-standards.md`]
- **Linting:** Use `ruff` for linting. [Source: `architecture/coding-standards.md`]
- **Naming Conventions:** Follow PEP 8 standards (e.g., `snake_case` for functions and variables). [Source: `architecture/coding-standards.md`]
- **Type Hints:** Use type hints for all function signatures. [Source: `architecture/coding-standards.md`]
- **DocString:** Include a comprehensive docstring for the endpoint function. [Source: `architecture/coding-standards.md`] 

#### Testing
- **Framework:** `pytest` [Source: `architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md`]
- **Location:** Unit tests should be placed in `services/orchestrator/tests/unit/`. [Source: `architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md`]
- **Coverage:** Aim for 80% code coverage. [Source: `architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md`]
- **Test File Convention:** Test files should be named `test_*.py`. [Source: `architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md`]

### QA Results

- **Status:** Reviewed
- **Date:** 2025-09-23
- **Reviewed by:** Quinn (Test Architect)
- **Summary:** The story provides a solid and well-documented plan for initializing the project. The tasks are clear, directly traceable to acceptance criteria, and correctly reference all relevant architecture and standards documents. The overall quality of the story is high. One minor improvement is to explicitly mention the requirement for docstrings as per the coding standards.
- **Issues Found:**
  - The tasks do not explicitly mention adding docstrings to the new function(s), which is required by the project's coding standards.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Add a subtask to ensure docstrings are included for the health check endpoint function.
