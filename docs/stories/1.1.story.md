Title: Project Scaffolding & Health Check
Status: Draft

### Story

As a DevOps Engineer, I want to initialize the Python project structure with LangGraph at the core of the orchestrator and create a basic HTTP server with FastAPI with a `/health` endpoint, so that I have a runnable application to build upon and a way to verify it's running correctly.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new Python project is initialized with a standard, scalable layout.
2.  A basic HTTP server is implemented using FastAPI.
3.  A `GET /health` endpoint is created.
4.  When called, the `/health` endpoint returns a `200 OK` status code and a JSON body: `{"status": "ok"}`.

### Dev Notes

#### Tech Stack & Project Structure
- **Language:** Python 3.12.11 [Source: `architecture/tech-stack.md`]
- **Framework:** FastAPI 0.116.1 [Source: `architecture/tech-stack.md`]
- **Dependency Management:** Poetry 2.2.2 [Source: `architecture/tech-stack.md`]
- **Project Structure:** A monorepo structure will be used. The main orchestrator service should be located at `services/orchestrator/`. [Source: `architecture/source-tree.md`]
- **Application Entrypoint:** The main FastAPI application should be in `services/orchestrator/app/main.py`. [Source: `architecture/source-tree.md`]

#### API Specifications
- **Endpoint:** `GET /health`
- **Success Response:**
  - **Status Code:** 200 OK
  - **Body:** `{"status": "ok"}`
  [Source: `architecture/rest-api-spec.md`]

#### Coding Standards
- **Formatting:** Use `black` for code formatting. [Source: `architecture/coding-standards.md`]
- **Linting:** Use `ruff` for linting. [Source: `architecture/coding-standards.md`]
- **Naming Conventions:** Follow PEP 8 standards (e.g., `snake_case` for functions and variables). [Source: `architecture/coding-standards.md`]
- **Type Hints:** Use type hints for all function signatures. [Source: `architecture/coding-standards.md`]

#### Testing Requirements
- **Framework:** `pytest` [Source: `architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md`]
- **Location:** Unit tests should be placed in `services/orchestrator/tests/unit/`. [Source: `architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md`]
- **Coverage:** Aim for 80% code coverage. [Source: `architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md`]
- **Test File Convention:** Test files should be named `test_*.py`. [Source: `architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md`]

### Tasks / Subtasks

1.  **(AC: 1)** **Initialize Poetry Project:**
    - In the root of the monorepo, create the `services/orchestrator` directory.
    - Run `poetry init` to create the `pyproject.toml` for the orchestrator service.
    - Add `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pytest`, `ruff`, and `black` as dependencies.
    - Configure the `pyproject.toml` to align with the monorepo structure. [Source: `architecture/source-tree.md`]
2.  **(AC: 1)** **Create Application Structure:**
    - Create the directory structure `services/orchestrator/app/api/v1`.
    - Create the main application file at `services/orchestrator/app/main.py`.
    - Create necessary `__init__.py` files. [Source: `architecture/source-tree.md`]
3.  **(AC: 2, 3)** **Implement FastAPI Server and Health Endpoint:**
    - In `services/orchestrator/app/main.py`, create a FastAPI app instance.
    - Implement a `GET /health` endpoint that returns the specified JSON response. [Source: `architecture/rest-api-spec.md`]
4.  **(AC: 4)** **Write Unit Tests:**
    - Create a test file `services/orchestrator/tests/unit/test_main.py`.
    - Write a unit test for the `/health` endpoint to verify the status code and response body.
    - Ensure the test follows the AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern. [Source: `architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md`]
5.  **Finalize and Format:**
    - Run `black` and `ruff` to format and lint the code.
    - Run `pytest` to ensure all tests pass.
