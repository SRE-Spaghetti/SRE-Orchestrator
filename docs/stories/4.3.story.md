Epic: 4
Story: 3
Title: Startup Integration and Error Handling
Status: Ready for Review
---

### Story

**As an** SRE,
**I want** the SRE Orchestrator to initialize MCP connections during startup with comprehensive error handling,
**so that** I can quickly identify and resolve MCP connectivity issues without impacting core functionality.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  MCP connection initialization is integrated into the FastAPI application startup sequence.
2.  The application startup includes MCP connection health checks and reports connection status.
3.  Failed MCP connections are logged as warnings but do not prevent application startup.
4.  The `/health` endpoint is enhanced to include MCP connection status information.
5.  Existing functionality (incident API endpoints) remains unaffected by MCP connection failures.
6.  Clear documentation is provided for MCP configuration format and troubleshooting connection issues.

### Dev Notes

#### Previous Story Insights
- Story 4.1 created MCP configuration loading with `MCPConfigService`
- Story 4.2 implemented `MCPConnectionManager` with connection establishment and error handling
- The foundation for MCP integration is complete; this story focuses on startup integration and system health monitoring

#### Application Startup Integration
- **Existing Pattern:** Follow `KnowledgeGraphService` initialization pattern in `main.py` startup event [Source: services/orchestrator/src/app/main.py:11-16]
- **Startup Event:** Extend existing `startup_event()` function to include MCP initialization [Source: services/orchestrator/src/app/main.py]
- **Error Handling:** Ensure MCP connection failures don't prevent application startup [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]

#### Health Check Enhancement
- **Existing Endpoint:** `/health` endpoint already exists returning `{"status": "ok"}` [Source: services/orchestrator/src/app/main.py:19-24]
- **Enhancement Pattern:** Add MCP connection status to health response
- **Response Format:** Extend JSON response to include MCP server status information
- **API Compatibility:** Maintain backward compatibility with existing health check format

#### File Locations
- **Main Application:** `services/orchestrator/src/app/main.py` (startup event modification) [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Health Endpoint:** Update existing `/health` endpoint in `main.py` [Source: services/orchestrator/src/app/main.py:19-24]
- **Documentation:** Create/update documentation for MCP configuration [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

#### System Integration Requirements
- **Non-Breaking Changes:** Existing incident API endpoints must remain unchanged [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Graceful Degradation:** System operates normally even with failed MCP connections
- **Monitoring:** Provide clear visibility into MCP connection health for operations teams

### Testing

#### Testing Standards
- **Framework:** pytest [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
- **Unit Tests:** `services/orchestrator/tests/unit/` [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
- **Integration Tests:** `services/orchestrator/tests/integration/` [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#integration-tests]
- **End-to-End Tests:** Test complete startup sequence and health checks [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#end-to-end-tests]
- **Coverage Requirement:** 80% [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]

### Tasks / Subtasks

1. [x] **Integrate MCP Initialization into Startup Sequence (AC: 1, 3)**
   - [ ] Modify `startup_event()` in `services/orchestrator/src/app/main.py`
   - [ ] Add MCP configuration loading using `MCPConfigService` from Story 4.1
   - [ ] Initialize `MCPConnectionManager` from Story 4.2

2. [x] **Implement MCP Health Checks (AC: 2, 4)**
   - [ ] Enhance `/health` endpoint to include MCP connection status
   - [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing `{"status": "ok"}` response
   - [ ] Add MCP server connection status for each configured server
   - [ ] Include connection health indicators (connected, failed, not configured)
   - [ ] Ensure health check response time remains within 500ms requirement

3. [x] **Ensure System Resilience (AC: 5)**
   - [ ] Verify existing incident API endpoints remain fully functional with MCP failures

   - [ ] Document MCP configuration file format and examples
   - [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common MCP connection issues
   - [ ] Add README section explaining MCP configuration setup
   - [ ] Document health check endpoint enhancements

5. [x] **Write Comprehensive Tests (AC: 1-5)**
   - [ ] Create `test_startup_integration.py` in `services/orchestrator/tests/unit/`
   - [ ] Test startup sequence with successful MCP connections
   - [ ] Test startup sequence with failed MCP connections (should not prevent startup)
   - [ ] Test enhanced `/health` endpoint with various MCP connection states
   - [ ] Create integration test verifying core functionality works with MCP failures
   - [ ] Test application startup time with MCP initialization
   - [ ] Achieve 80% test coverage requirement
