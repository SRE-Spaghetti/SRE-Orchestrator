### Story

As a Developer, I want comprehensive documentation that reflects the refactored architecture, so that I can understand the new design and how to use and extend the system.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. `docs/architecture.md` is updated to remove k8s-agent references and document the new architecture
2. `docs/langgraph-workflow.md` is created to document the ReAct agent pattern
3. `docs/mcp-integration.md` is created to document MCP server configuration
4. `docs/cli-guide.md` is created with CLI usage examples
5. `README.md` is updated with new architecture overview and setup instructions
6. All component diagrams are updated to reflect the MCP-based architecture

### Dev Notes

#### Architecture Documentation Updates
**Files to Update:**
- `docs/architecture.md`: Remove k8s-agent references, document LangChain/LangGraph integration
- `README.md`: Update project overview, architecture diagram, installation instructions
[Source: `.kiro/specs/orchestrator-refactoring/design.md` Section 9]

**New Documentation Files:**
1. `docs/langgraph-workflow.md`: Detailed workflow documentation
2. `docs/mcp-integration.md`: MCP server setup and tool development
3. `docs/cli-guide.md`: CLI user guide with examples
[Source: `.kiro/specs/orchestrator-refactoring/design.md` Section 9]

#### LangGraph Workflow Documentation
Should cover:
- ReAct agent pattern explanation
- How the agent decides which tools to use
- Investigation workflow steps
- Examples of agent investigations
- How to customize the system prompt
[Source: `.kiro/specs/orchestrator-refactoring/tasks.md` Task 8.2]

#### MCP Integration Guide
Should cover:
- MCP server configuration format
- How to add new MCP servers
- Supported transports (stdio, streamable_http)
- Examples of custom MCP tools
- Security considerations for MCP connections
[Source: `.kiro/specs/orchestrator-refactoring/tasks.md` Task 8.3]

#### CLI User Guide
Should cover:
- CLI installation (pip/pipx)
- Configuration setup
- Usage examples for all commands:
  - `sre-orchestrator chat`
  - `sre-orchestrator investigate`
  - `sre-orchestrator list`
  - `sre-orchestrator show`
  - `sre-orchestrator config`
- Authentication setup
- Troubleshooting
[Source: `.kiro/specs/orchestrator-refactoring/tasks.md` Task 8.4]

#### Component Diagrams
Update to show:
- LangGraph workflow engine
- LangChain LLM client
- MCP tool manager
- CLI application
- Remove k8s-agent service
[Source: `.kiro/specs/orchestrator-refactoring/design.md` Architecture section]
