# Checklist Results Report

### Executive Summary
- **Overall Architecture Readiness:** High
- **Critical Risks Identified:** None. The main dependency is on the selection of a final LLM provider, which is a known TBD.
- **Key Strengths:** The architecture is a straightforward, modern implementation of a microservices pattern that directly aligns with the PRD. It is well-documented and provides a solid foundation for the MVP.
- **Project Type:** Backend service. All frontend-specific sections of the checklist were skipped.
